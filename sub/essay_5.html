                            "Honorable Judge, my name is Blizzard, and I am here to defend the case of my fellow rainbow-colored Skyfolk. I believe that this accusation is unfair to everyone in this room. Let me ask you, why is it unnatural to be rainbow?"
                            <br /><br/>
                            Silence followed.
                            <br /><br/>
                            "Why, then, do others think that being rainbow is a choice, as it is evident that no one has chosen to be black and white? Why is it wrong to be different? Have we hurt anyone else by being who we are? Why are we in court for being multi-colored, when we were born this way? Why are we the criminals when many of us were the ones who got hurt, abused, disowned, and harassed--just for being ourselves? 
                            <br /><br/>
                            “A few weeks ago, a blue-pink-and-white friend of mine was found dead, floating in the river, and a person of the same color was murdered because she didn't tell her boyfriend that she was a transfolk. We are discriminated upon because we're rainbow-colored. We are called names and pushed around and made to feel bad about ourselves. Some are being forced to go to conversion camps and are being hurt or even killed. Yet we are the ones who are being accused as criminals? Skyfolk aged 10 to 24 who were born like us are almost five times as likely to have attempted suicide than black-and-white youth, and rainbow youth who have been victimized, whether physical, verbal, or otherwise have an increased likelihood of self-harming behavior by 2.5 times on average.
                            <br /><br/>
                            “We are the ones getting oppressed yet we're the bad people just because of tradition? Many people are getting hurt by your practices, and as the new generation we have a choice to break this tradition, so I'm going to ask you the same question we have been asked to answer all these years. When will you make the right choice?
                            “Skytown boasts of its splendor, with its vibrant buildings and elaborate rain displays, but it turns against the people that make it happen. To say that we are unrepresented in our community is an understatement. We are everywhere—in the streets, in the rain pumps, in the cloud generators. We are scared to come out and show our true selves because our toxic society keeps pushing us back into hiding.
                            <br /><br/>
                            <blockquote>Even if you paint us black and white, we are still rainbow on the inside. We are different, but we are special. We are not ill, and we are not contagious. It's not bad, and we don't need to be cured. You can't spray the shade away, but what you can do is accept that some Skyfolk are born this way, and not everyone is black and white.</blockquote>
                            “Now, let me ask you a question. How would you feel if our roles were reversed? What if the whole city is filled with us multi-colored people, and those born black-and-white were persecuted? You say that it is a choice to be rainbow, so when did you choose to be black and white? Why should we change ourselves because you are not the same as us? If you were in that multi-colored society and you were asked to change because everyone else wanted you to even though you are perfectly happy with who you are, what would you feel? I need all of you to put yourselves in our shoes and consider what we are feeling right now.
                            <br /><br/>
                            “Even if you paint us black and white, we are still rainbow on the inside. We are different, but we are special. We are not ill, and we are not contagious. It's not bad, and we don't need to be cured. You can't spray the shade away, but what you can do is accept that some Skyfolk are born this way, and not everyone is black and white. So I'm going to ask you again. When will you make the right choice?"
                            <br /><br/>
                            The judge was left speechless, and the whole room applauded. To their surprise, the court decided to junk the case. Drizzle ran to Blizzard and hugged him. "You were great up there. I'm proud of you. Thank you for speaking out when we can't speak for ourselves." Blizzard grinned. "It's a challenge, but I really do hope that the Skyfolk would make the right choice."
                            <br /><br/>
                            Slowly, Skytown changed. All the Spray the Shade Away camps were closed, and counselling centers for rainbow youths were put in their place. Information campaigns were created to debunk myths about multicolored Skyfolk. People were not afraid to show their true colors anymore, and the Shade Parade was made into a national holiday. Violence against the rainbows were severely punished, and the rainbow people were free to mingle with anyone they wanted. Now, when you go to Skytown, you'll see a big sign saying "Welcome to Skytown, Home of Original Rainbows."

                                <p>I love the subtleties of the satirical elements here in the story, and how it highlights how ironic homophobia in general is. It's written in a way that's easy to understand, but each and every line shows things that we can explore if we dig deeper.</p>

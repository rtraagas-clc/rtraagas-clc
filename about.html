                    </div>
                    <p>Yael is currently a Computer Science 3 student from Batch 2024 of the Philippine Science High School-Central Luzon Campus. He's (learning to be) a full stack web developer, a graphic designer, video editor, book geek and musical theater nerd.

                    Up in the Clouds is a satirical essay combatting homophobia. The essay itself was submitted in his English 3 course which required them to write an essay about a global problem that needed to be faced, in a satirical style. As a person who identifies as a gender-fluid panromatic homosexual individual (with pronouns he/him and they/them), he wanted to write about his past (and still present) experiences with homophobia, in school and at home. The topic is very relevant today, as homophobia is still very much around and many people are getting hurt, disowned or in severe cases, killed, due to their sexuality and some have experienced going through cruel conversion camps that "Pray the Gay Away" (which inspired the part about "Spray the Shade Away.") He mixed fact with fiction in the essay showing the irony of homophobia through the words of Blizzard, one of the main characters, citing real-world statistics about what LGBTQIA+ people, especially youth, are still experiencing today.

                    <p><b>Favorite quote</b> Even if you paint us black and white, we are still rainbow on the inside. We are different, but we are special. We are not ill, and we are not contagious. It's not bad, and we don't need to be cured. You can't spray the shade away, but what you can do is accept that some Skyfolk are born this way, and not everyone is black and white.</p>

                        <h5>Up in the Clouds</h5>
                    </div>
                    <p>Black-and-white people represent the “normal” heterosexuals while the multi-colored Skyfolk represents those in the LGBTQ+ community.
                        <br><br>
                        As a satirical essay, there are elements of satire found all around the essay. Here are some of them:
                        <br><br>
                        
                       <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                            <li>The supposed “solution” to the “problem” of being a multi-colored Skyfolk was to paint them the normal color. This is an exaggerated response to the situation that has a deeper meaning—this represents how members of the LGBTQ+ community are told by society, and sometimes even forced, to hide their true colors and paint on a fake personality just to be “normal”. The paint symbolizes the toxicity of this practice, and how dangerous repressing your true self might be, just like how the act of painting on your skin would be an unhealthy practice.</li>

                            <li>In relation to painting, the camp “Spray the Shade Away” is a nod to gay conversion camps that (somehow) still exist. This is also a form of irony where Drizzle was supposed to be happy because he was changed “for the better” even though he did not have a good experience with the place.</li>

                            <li>The poster “We pride ourselves with rain, we pride ourselves with rainbows” is an irony—the town is proud of rain but won’t accept their people who are RAIN-bow colored.</li>

                            <li>Many satirical elements are in Blizzard’s speech. One of which is the role reversal, in which Blizzard talks about an alternate reality where being rainbow is the norm and being black-and-white was to be ashamed of. His statement “You say that it is a choice to be rainbow, so when did you choose to be black and white?” highlights the irony of the mentality that being a part of the LGBTQ+ community is a choice. His line “Some are being forced to go to conversion camps and are being hurt or even killed. Yet we are the ones who are being accused as criminals?” also brings the injustice of queer people being antagonized while oppressed by others into light. What he said about being “unrepresented in our community” was truly an understatement in some countries. My favorite line, “Even if you paint us black and white, we are still rainbow on the inside” shows us how ironic the proposed solution was, because others can change the outside, but inside, nothing is different.</li>
